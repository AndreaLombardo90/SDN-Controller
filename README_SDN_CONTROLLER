*********************************************


SDN Controller is a POX module that can monitor and manage traffic between OpenFlow-compatible switches
according to user-defined rules.

System Requirements:

- Python 2.7 (WARNING: POX can't work on Python 3!)
- POX controller for OpenFlow SDN
- root privileges


How to run SDN Controller:

There are a couple of things to be done before launching SDN Controller.
If you don't need to define user traffic classes, routing rules and network topology data, you can run 
SDN Controller directly with the following command:

sudo ./pox.py SDN_Controller

You can specify different traffic queues policies by editing "queues_policies.conf" file.
This file follows the following grammar:

#CLASS_NAME# #MAX_BANDWIDTH#

e.g.:

FREE 10
PREMIUM 20
ULTRA 30

Bandwidth is expressed in Mbps.

Once you defined different classes in "queues_policies.conf", you can then assign users to them.
In order to do that you need to edit "users_classes.conf".

It follows this grammar:

#CLASS_NAME#
#IP1|MAC1#
#IP2|MAC2#
[...]
#IPN|MACN#
#CLASS_NAME2#
#IP1|MAC1#
[..]

e.g.:

FREE
10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
PREMIUM
10.0.0.6
ULTRA
10.0.0.7

You can also define routing rules by editing "rules.conf" file.
Rules define what kind of packets and from/to who must be dropped by switches.
All rules always apply for every switch in the network.

Rules follow this grammar:

#MAC|IP# DROP

(drop packets with source address equal to MAC or IP specified)

FROM #MAC|IP# TO #MAC|IP# DROP

(drop packets with source and destination addresses equal to MACs or IPs specified)

IF #PROTOCOL# FROM #MAC|IP# DROP

(drop packets from source MAC/IP specified that travel on #PROTOCOL# *)

IF #PROTOCOL# FROM #MAC|IP# TO #MAC|IP# DROP

(drop packets that go from source MAC/IP to destination MAC/IP that travel on #PROTOCOL# *)

#MAC|IP# #PORT# DROP

(drop packets incoming from MAC/IP belonging to the port specified)

FROM #MAC|IP# #PORT# TO #MAC|IP# DROP

(drop packets that go from MAC/IP to MAC/IP, belonging to the port specified for source address)

FROM #MAC|IP# TO #MAC|IP# #PORT# DROP

(drop packets that go from MAC/IP to MAC/IP, belonging to the port specified for destination address)

FROM #MAC|IP# #PORT# TO #MAC|IP# #PORT# DROP

(drop packets that go from MAC/IP to MAC/IP, belonging to the ports specified for source address and destination address)



* #PROTOCOL# can be picked from these: IPV4, TCP, UDP, DHCP, ICMP, DNS and LLDP.

e.g.:

10.0.0.1 DROP

FROM 10.0.0.1 22 DROP

FROM 10.0.0.1 22 TO 10.0.0.2 22 DROP


SDN Controller can retrieve network topology simply by observing traffic in the network.
Unfortunately, it can't get information about bandwidth of links in the network.
You can specify the bandwidth of the various links by specifing them in "bandwidths.conf" file.
You don't need to specify bandwidth of all links: if you specify only for a subset of them, SDN Controller
will assert a bandwidth of 1Mbps for the unspecified links. 

"bandwidth.conf" follows this grammar:

#MAC1# #MAC2# #BANDWIDTH#

Bandwidth is expressed in Mbps.

e.g.:

1a-80-fd-4b-91-01 1a-80-fd-4b-91-02 10
1a-80-fd-4b-91-02 1a-80-fd-4b-91-04 10
1a-80-fd-4b-91-01 1a-80-fd-4b-91-03 20
